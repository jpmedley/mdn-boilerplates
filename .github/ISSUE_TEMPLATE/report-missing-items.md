Boilerplates are generated by an automated process. For this repo to accurately reflect what's in real browsers, we have to know about items this process is missing.

**Which Items are Missing?**
Where interfaces are missing, only interface names are needed (in other words, not the names of all of its members). 

**In Which Browsers are the Above Items Supported?**
For each browser state the status of the missing interface. Is it available by default? Or does it require special configuration such as a runtime flag or an origin trial to use?

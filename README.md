# MDN Boilerplates

*If an API isn't documented, it doesn't exist.*

This repo contains boilerplates for web platform APIs that are not currently documented on MDN. This simplifies the process of contributing to MDN by:

* limiting the number of MDN writing requirements you need to learn
* letting you focus on what you know best: the content you're contributing.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisite:** Fork and clone the [MDN Content repo](https://github.com/mdn/content). This is where your boilerplates will be submitted.

1. Check the [existing Intents to Document](https://github.com/jpmedley/mdn-boilerplates/labels/Intent%20to%20Document) to see if anyone else is working on items that you want to document.
1. Open an [Intent to Document](https://github.com/jpmedley/mdn-boilerplates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=intent-to-document.md&title=%5BIntent+to+Document%5D+Description+to+Cover+Work+or+a+Spec+Name) to let other know what you want to work on. This helps avoid duplication of effort.
1. Download the folder containing the interface or interface members you want to document and place them in the `api/` folder of your MDN Content repo. This folder is at `*repoLocation/*files/en-us/web/api`.

1. Submit a pull request to the MDN content repo. MDN personelle or a volunteer will review your submission for typos and conformance with standards. You may be asked to make changes.

**Note:** You may request a review by me (Joe Medley). My GitHub ID is jpmedley.

## Report a Missing API
